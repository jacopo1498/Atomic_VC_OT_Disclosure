Content Management Systems -> need to check your age/property to see if you are an adult

i need to 

generate atomic vc
generate sub signature
use ot to disclose

the subjectâ€™s DID in the credential, matches the DID of the subject who sent the presentation; ->use somebody else vc? 
sign vc with your privat key so reciver can verify that is indeed you

solution sign with privatekey associated with your did
create json with signature of payload + issuer signature (metadata in the header)

avoid digital signature reuse/replay !
ensure nonce is new
ensure token is not expired
ensure receiver is correct
verify everything through the use of signature



npx hardhat ignition deploy ./ignition/modules/deployDIDreg.ts --network localhost

npx hardhat run scripts/createAtomicVC.ts --network localhost
